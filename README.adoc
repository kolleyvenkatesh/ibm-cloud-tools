= K8s &amp; IBM Cloud tools

Scripts &amp; everything related to Kubernetes, Istio &amp; IBM Cloud.

== IBM Cloud Account

Have a look at https://github.com/sdaschner/ibm-cloud-tools/tree/master/cloud-access.adoc[cloud-access.adoc^] how to get access to the IBM Cloud and how to create your Kubernetes cluster.


== Scripts

The folder `kubectl/` contains a few scripts to forward Istio component ports, gather information, and delete resources.

The folder https://github.com/sdaschner/ibm-cloud-tools/tree/master/ibmcloud-scripts[ibmcloud-scripts] contains ``ibmcloud``-specific scripts to quickly connect to clusters, or manually install and deinstall Istio.

All scripts are meant to serve as examples, as inspiration what's possible in the command line.
Any issues, recommendations, or feedback are highly welcome!


== Aliases

`aliases` contains a few of the aliases I personally use for `ibmcloud`, `kubectl`, and `istioctl`.
