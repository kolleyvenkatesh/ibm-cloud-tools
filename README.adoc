= IBM Cloud tools

Scripts & everything related to IBM Cloud.
These are targeted for my personal usage.
I'm not a CLI / Bash expert, so please don't judge the scripts too hard :-)


== Add IKS cluster to kubectl contexts

`ibmcloud-add-cluster` adds a created IKS cluster to the local kube config (usually under `~/.kube/config`).


== Install Istio

`ibmcloud-install-istio` batch-installs Istio to a Kubernetes cluster, including the following Helm features / flags: `tracing.enabled`, `grafana.enabled`, `kiali.enabled`.

Requires `helm` (without Tiller), and an Istio release repository being checked-out under `~/workspaces/oss/istio-1.0.0/`.
Please see and modify the script.


== Install NGINX ingress

`ibmcloud-install-nginx`; currently in progress.
